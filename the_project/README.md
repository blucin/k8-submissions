# The Project

This is a project to learn kubernetes from the MOOC.fi course "DevOps with Kubernetes".

## Getting Started

1. Make sure your local k3d cluster is running
```bash
k3d cluster create -a 2
```

2. Build the Docker image and import it to your local k3d cluster

```bash
docker build -t the-project .
k3d image import the-project:latest
```

3. Run the deployment using kubectl

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/deployment.yaml

kubectl get pods

# Test the server, use your pod name
kubectl port-forward the-project-deployment-897564dc4-cmfdl 8080:8080
```
